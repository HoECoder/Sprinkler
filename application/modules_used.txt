This program uses the following modules not included with Python:

Cerberus - Schema Validator 
Use: Used to make sure various config files match a spec, smooths processing
URL: http://docs.python-cerberus.org/en/stable/
ModuleName: cerberus

PyTZ - Time Zone Code
Use: Used to make sure time zones are working correctly. Mostly in unit-tests,
as the program clock is run in UTC. However, users entire time in the local 
time zone relative to midnight. Mostly, want to make sure the short and long 
days work right. Note: the TZ implementation, at least on Win7, doesn't respect
historical Std/DST boundary rules.
